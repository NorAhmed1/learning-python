    "- Object Oriented Programming allows programmers to create their own objects that have methods and attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recall that after defining a string, list, dict, or other objects, you were able to call methods off of them with the .method_name() syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "- These methods act as functions that use information about the object, as well as the object itself to return results or change the current object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example this includes appending to a list, or counting the occurences of an element in a tuple.\n",
