    "Unit TestingÂ¶\n",
    "- Equally important as writing good code is writing good tests. Better to find bugs yourself than have them reported to you by end users!\n",
    "\n",
    "- For this section we'll be working with files outside the notebook. We'll save our code to a .py file, and then save our test script to another .py file. Normally we would code these files using a text editor like Brackets or Atom, or inside an IDE like Spyder or Pycharm. But, since we're here, let's use Jupyter!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recall that with some IPython magic we can write the contents of a cell to a file using %%writefile.\n",
    "- Something we haven't seen yet; you can run terminal commands from a jupyter cell using !\n",

    "- Testing tools\n",
    "-- There are dozens of good testing libraries out there. Most are third-party packages that require an install, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   pylint\n",
    "   \n",
    "   pyflakes\n",
    "  \n",
    "   pep8\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "- These are simple tools that merely look at your code, and they'll tell you if there are style issues or simple problems like variable names being called before assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A far better way to test your code is to write tests that send sample data to your program, and compare what's returned to a desired outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two such tools are available from the standard library:\n",
